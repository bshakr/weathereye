#Weather web app 

This is a weather web app targeted for the iPhone.

The app's backend is written in Ruby. It is a small sinatra app. The client side is written in coffeescript. The weather data comes from the forecast.io API.

*Note* that this will only work on an iPhone. Future updates will include support for other devices.
